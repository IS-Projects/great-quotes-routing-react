# great-quotes-routing-react
This repository is created based on the 20th and 21st modules of the course "React - The Complete Guide 2022" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. It covers how to connect to a "database" to validate the authentication. In this example, we are using endpoints provided by Firebase (if interested, this is the link to the documentation https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth). This is not a complete application. It just demonstrates the principles behind authentication and how to store information in a Provider to have data locally available.

## Script to run the project:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
